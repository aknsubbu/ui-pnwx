# Issue Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Equipment Category Card Alignment
**Problem**: Cards were not equally sized or aligned properly on the equipment category page.

**Solution**: 
- Added `className="h-full"` to the motion.div wrapper
- Added `flex flex-col` classes to the Card component
- Added `flex-grow` to CardBody to ensure it takes up available space
- Added `mt-auto` to CardFooter to push it to the bottom

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/equipment-category-card.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Accessories & Supplies Category Pages Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking "Explore category" on accessories and supplies pages resulted in 404 errors.

**Solution**:
- Added `baseUrl` prop to `CatalogPage` component
- Updated `EquipmentCategoryCard` to accept and use `baseUrl` prop for dynamic routing
- Updated all page files to pass the correct `baseUrl`:
  - Equipment: `baseUrl="equipment"`
  - Accessories: `baseUrl="accessories"`
  - Supplies: `baseUrl="supplies"`
  - Parts: `baseUrl="parts"`

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/catalog-page.tsx`
- `/components/equipment-category-card.tsx`
- `/app/equipment/page.tsx`
- `/app/accessories/page.tsx`
- `/app/supplies/page.tsx`

---

### 3. ✅ Product Cards Linking to External Site
**Problem**: Clicking on a product from a category page took users directly to the PNWX website.

**Solution**:
- Replaced single "View Details" button with two buttons:
  - **Quick View** (primary): Links to internal anchor `#${subcategory.id}` for future modal/detail view
  - **PNWX** (secondary): External link to original PNWX site for complete specifications
- This keeps users within the app while still providing access to detailed specs

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/equipment-subcategory-card.tsx`

---

### 4. ✅ Parts Page Implementation
**Problem**: The Parts section (https://www.pnwx.com/Parts/) needed to be replicated.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive Parts data file with 4 main categories:
  1. **X-Ray Grids** (45 items)
  2. **X-Ray Collimators** (28 items)
  3. **Collimator Lamps** (32 items)
  4. **High Voltage Cables** (18 items)
- Created Parts catalog page using the generic `CatalogPage` component
- Created dynamic Parts category detail page at `/parts/[id]`
- Added Parts to main navigation menu

**Files Created**:
- `/data/parts.json`
- `/app/parts/page.tsx`
- `/app/parts/[id]/page.tsx`
- `/app/parts/[id]/layout.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `/config/site.ts` (added Parts to navigation)

## Architecture Improvements

### Reusable Component System
All catalog pages (Equipment, Accessories, Supplies, Parts) now use the same components:
- `CatalogPage` - Main catalog layout with filtering
- `EquipmentCategoryCard` - Category overview cards
- `EquipmentSubcategoryCard` - Product detail cards
- `EquipmentContactCard` - Contact information sidebar
- `EquipmentOrderInfoCard` - Ordering requirements sidebar

### Dynamic Routing
Each section now has dynamic category pages:
- `/equipment/[id]` - Equipment category details
- `/accessories/[id]` - Accessories category details
- `/supplies/[id]` - Supplies category details
- `/parts/[id]` - Parts category details

### Navigation Flow
1. **Main Catalog Page** → Browse all categories with search/filter
2. **Category Detail Page** → View all products in specific category
3. **Product Actions**:
   - Quick View (internal - future implementation)
   - PNWX Link (external - detailed specs)

### EquipmentCategoryCard
```tsx
// Before
href={`/equipment/${category.id}`}

// After
href={`/${baseUrl}/${category.id}`}  // Dynamic based on section
```

### EquipmentSubcategoryCard
```tsx
// Before
<Button href={subcategory.url} isExternal>
  View Details

<Button href={`#${subcategory.id}`}>Quick View</Button>
<Button href={subcategory.url} isExternal>PNWX</Button>
```

### CatalogPage
```tsx
// Before
interface CatalogPageProps {
  data: EquipmentData;
  // ...
}

// After
interface CatalogPageProps {
  data: EquipmentData;
  baseUrl: string;  // New required prop
  // ...
}
```
