## Next Steps

### 1. Customize Specifications
The script added **generic sample data**. You should:
- Edit `data/equipment.json` (and other files)
- Replace generic specs with real data from PNWX
- Add product-specific features
- Update dimensions with actual measurements

### 2. Add More Images
Currently using single images. To add more:
```json
{
  "images": [
    "main-image.jpg",
    "side-view.jpg",
    "detail-view.jpg",
    "in-use.jpg"
  ]

{
  "documents": [
    {
      "name": "User Manual",
      "url": "https://www.pnwx.com/docs/manual.pdf",
      "type": "manual"
    },
    {
      "name": "Spec Sheet",
      "url": "https://www.pnwx.com/docs/specs.pdf",
      "type": "pdf"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Add Pricing (Optional)
```json
{
  "pricing": {
    "msrp": "$8,995",
    "note": "Installation and training included"
  }
}
```

3. Update the fields:

```json
{
  "id": "your-product-id",
  "name": "Your Product Name",
  "description": "Detailed description...",
  
  "specifications": {
    "Key Spec 1": "Value",
    "Key Spec 2": "Value"
  },

## Need Real PNWX Data?

If you want to scrape actual data from PNWX:

1. **Manual approach** (most accurate):
   - Visit each product page on PNWX
   - Copy specifications
   - Paste into JSON files

2. **Semi-automated**:
   - Use the scraping script as reference
   - Extract data for priority products
   - Gradually build your database

3. **Focus on high-value products**:
   - Start with best sellers
   - Add specs to featured items first
   - Expand to full catalog over time

## Support

- **Documentation**: See `/docs/STANDALONE_SPECIFICATIONS_GUIDE.md`
- **Type Definitions**: See `/types/equipment.ts`
- **Product Page**: See `/app/equipment/[categoryId]/[productId]/page.tsx`
